	<p><span class="secret">'</span>Who is Kenneth Roraback?<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>Call me Kenny! I am a young(ish) designer&ndash;theater director&ndash;scientist&ndash;videographer&ndash;musician&ndash;reader&ndash;writer&ndash;thinker&ndash;creative professional who is currently based in New York City. I work for <a href="https://learnwithhomer.com" title="Learn with Homer" target="_blank"><em>Homer,</em> an amazing education technology company,</a> but I was first drawn to New York by the MFA program in Design and Technology at Parsons, The New School for Design. I am particularly interested in unique interfaces, quirky design, and experiences that push me to think in new ways. I tend to consider myself a &lsquo;planner,&rsquo; but I love surprises, particularly in the design and art that I experience. I like work that has social implications, that makes me uncomfortable, and that provokes discussion, debate and strong reactions&mdash;positive <em>or</em> negative&mdash;from its viewers.<span class="secret">',</span></p>
	<p><span class="secret">'</span>Dude, what&rsquo;s up with these header and footer images? It looks like a little kid drew them...<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>A little kid <em>did</em> make this. The image is of a &lsquo;golden hedgebat,&rsquo; which I invented/imagined and drew in elementary school. Golden hedgebats were a contemporary of dinosaurs that flew seasonally between the Arctic and much of the northern hemisphere, and they were frozen in a state of hibernation within the Arctic during the ice age that ended the Cretaceous Period. Due to global warming and the melting of our polar ice caps, however, they have reawakened and adapted to modern society. Golden hedgebats are very intelligent, and often adopt human families, living with them much like a sibling or close friend. (Yeah, I was a weird little kid.)<span class="secret">',</span></p>
	<p><span class="secret">'</span>What&rsquo;s up with this design?<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret. (Okay, true, now that it&rsquo;s on my website, it isn&rsquo;t so secret): I am tired of seeing pristine white portfolio sites that are designed to have as little character as possible, in the interest of &lsquo;showing off the work.&rsquo; I have personality. I have character. If a website is meant to represent me, then it had better have personality and character, as well. This site was inspired by my love of both creative and analytical endeavors. The colors and titling are inspired by my programming experience and the cobalt color scheme in TextMate, which I use for most of my coding. By the way, highlight the text for a code-related surprise.<span class="secret">'</span></p>
