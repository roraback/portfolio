	<p><span class="secret">'</span>Who is Kenneth Roraback?<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>Call me Kenny! I am a user experience designer&ndash;interaction designer&ndash;scientist&ndash;engineer&ndash;theater director&ndash;videographer&ndash;musician&ndash;reader&ndash;writer&ndash;thinker&ndash;creative professional who is currently based in Washington, DC via New York, Boston, and Lindsborg, Kansas. I moved to Boston in 2002 to study at MIT and become an astrophysicist, only to discover upon working in the Center for Space Research as an undergraduate that I needed a more even mix of creative and analytical challenges as I work&mdash;and partiularly that I love to make things. At MIT, that translated into double degrees in physics and theater, but I was drawn to New York in 2012 by Parsonsâ€™ MFA program in Design and Technology, where I studied user experience and interaction design. I stayed in New York for another 3 years to design <a href="https://learnwithhomer.com" title="Learn with Homer" target="_blank"><em>Learn with Homer,</em> an amazing early literacy program.</a> In 2015 I moved to Washington, DC to join an awesome up-and-coming <a href="http://www.fastorientation.com/" target="_blank">network security startup called Fast Orientation</a>, where I designed the UX/UI for a beta product that helps companies better understand how their networks are functioning. As a designer of interactive media, I am particularly drawn toward projects that I believe will make a positive impact in the world around me. I love unique interfaces, quirky design, and experiences that push me to think in new ways. I tend to consider myself a &lsquo;planner,&rsquo; but I love surprises, particularly in the design and art that I experience. I love work that has social implications, that makes me uncomfortable, and that provokes discussion, debate and strong reactions&mdash;positive <em>or</em> negative&mdash;from its viewers.<span class="secret">',</span></p>
	<p><span class="secret">'</span>Dude, what&rsquo;s up with these header and footer images? It looks like a little kid drew them...<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>A little kid <em>did</em> draw them! The image is of a &lsquo;golden hedgebat,&rsquo; which I invented/imagined and drew in elementary school. Golden hedgebats were a contemporary of dinosaurs that flew seasonally between the Arctic and much of the northern hemisphere, and they were frozen in a state of hibernation within the Arctic during the ice age that ended the Cretaceous Period. Due to global warming and the melting of our polar ice caps, however, they have reawakened and adapted to modern society. Golden hedgebats are very intelligent, and often adopt human families, living with them much like a sibling or close friend. (Yeah, I was a weird little kid.)<span class="secret">',</span></p>
	<p><span class="secret">'</span>What&rsquo;s up with this design?<span class="secret">'</span> <mark>=&gt;</mark> <span class="secret">'</span>I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret. (Okay, true, now that it&rsquo;s on my website, it isn&rsquo;t so secret): I get tired of seeing pristine white portfolio sites that are made from templates, and that are designed to have as little character as possible, in the interest of showing off the work. I have personality. I have character. If a website is meant to represent me, then it had better have personality and character, as well. This site was inspired by my love of both creative and analytical endeavors. The colors and titling are inspired by my programming experience and the cobalt color scheme in TextMate, which was my favorite text editor for many years. By the way, highlight the text for a code-related surprise.<span class="secret">'</span></p>
